## 🔍 Key Projects & AI/ML Techniques

### **👟 Sneaker Market Segmentation: Nike vs. Adidas**
#### **Objective:**
Analyze product pricing, discount strategies, and market positioning of the two leading sportswear brands to identify similarities, differences, and opportunities.

#### **Techniques Used:**
- **Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN)** for product segmentation
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover pricing & discount trends
- **Market Basket Analysis** to determine frequently purchased items

#### **Key Insights:**
✅ Adidas provides more discounts, while Nike maintains a premium pricing strategy.  
✅ One-third of Nike's products are categorized as **premium**.  
✅ Discount-heavy products tend to perform better during **festive sales** (Black Friday, Christmas, etc.).

### **🍷 Wine Quality Prediction**
#### **Objective:**
Develop a machine learning model to classify wine quality based on key chemical attributes, reducing reliance on expensive human tasters.

#### **Techniques Used:**
- **Classification Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)** to predict premium wines
- **Feature Engineering** to identify critical factors like acidity, sulfates, and alcohol content
- **SHAP Analysis** to interpret model predictions

#### **Key Insights:**
✅ **Premium wines** have higher alcohol content, lower volatile acidity, and balanced sulfates.  
✅ The **ideal alcohol level** for premium wines is between **11-13%**.  
✅ Wines with **lower chlorides & higher citric acid** tend to be rated better.

#### **Business Recommendations:**
🍾 Optimize alcohol & acidity levels to maintain **consistent premium quality**.  
🔬 Implement AI-driven quality control for **cost-effective testing**.  
📊 Use predictive modeling to **streamline production processes** and reduce wastage.
